The first is a tree ring dataset collected by the Harvard Forest Research Area in 2012. Three 20m plots were measured following a double-nested design. The following species were included in the final ring width dataset:\n\n-   ACRU = red maple (Acer rubrum)\n-   BEAL = yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis)\n-   BELE = sweet birch (Betula lenta)\n-   FAGR = American beech (Fagus grandifolia)\n-   HAVI = Witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana)\n-   PIST = Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus)\n-   QURU = Northern red oak (Quercus rubra)\n-   QUVE = Black oak (Quercus velutina)\n-   TSCA = Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)\n\nHarvard forest tree ring data samples were collected\n\nCitation on tree ring dataset: Dye, A.

Censuses were conducted in 1962, 1969, 1975, 1987-1991, 2001, and 2011 and mapped all trees with DBH greater than 5 cm. in a mapped area covering 2.88 ha. The three ring-width plots include only a fraction of this area, and, therefore, we determined which census trees were located within the plot areas and considered only those trees for the model.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code to plot census data, by species\n```\n:::\n",
