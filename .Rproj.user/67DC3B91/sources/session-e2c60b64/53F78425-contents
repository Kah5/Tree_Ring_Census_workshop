# Biomass estimation from tree ring data and forest census data

## Estimating Forest biomass for trees at the time of census

### using allodb package

```{R, echo = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/allodb",upgrade = "never")

```

## Estimating Forest biomass from tree ring time-series

### Step 1: Back-calculate tree size over time (no uncertainty)

```{R}


```

### Step 2: Use AlloDB to estimate Biomass for each tree using the back-calculated tree size in each year

### Step 3: visualizing biomass over time (with no uncertainty)

```{R}


```

## Converting forest biomass to carbon using carbon fractions

The simplest way of estimating Carbon from tree-level biomass is to assume that the "carbon fraction," that is the fraction of the tree's weight that is made up of Carbon, is 50%, so multiplying your biomass value by 0.5 will give you a mass of Carbon per unit area.

Other carbon fractions are available, for example for live trees vs. dead trees, and for different forest types/species, but for simplicity we will use 0.5 here.
