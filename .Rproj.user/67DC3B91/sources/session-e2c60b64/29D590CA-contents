## State-space model for estimating biomass

## Load packages to be used

We estimate the parameters of this state-space model in a program called `stan` which interfaces to `R` via a package called `rstan` (`cmdstan` is another package that is used.)

```{R}
library(rstan)
```

# Uncertainty in Diameter reconstructions:

## Increment Uncertainty
Here is an example:
Our reconstruction of biomass uncertainty from Module 2 was created with one incrment core per tree. But reconstructions with multiple cores per tree highlight how cores from different parts of the trees can yield different growth and biomass estimates.
```{r}

```

## Diameter Uncertainty
Tree diameter measurements can vary due to observer errors, measurements at slightly different heights, furrows in the bark, etc. Here we show an example of multiple observers measuring the same tree diameters on the same day.

# Modelling data uncertainty
We can create data models that include these measurement and data uncertainties.

# Adding State-Space Process Model
# load the model data

```{r}

```

# Stan Model

```{r}
# add R stan code here
```

# add the math notation of the model here:

## Running the model: Example for a short run

```{r}
# run a version with a small # of iterations here to show the output
```

## The model outputs
Highlight the range of model outputs

Here, the main outputs that we are most interested in are growth and tree size, so we will focus on those in this workshop. Examples of these outputs and timeseries are shown below:
```{R}
# load the Full TR only model outputs
# put some example exploration of the model outputs here
```

## Model Checking in stan:
In addition to the growth and diameter estimates, there are other model outputs and diagnostics that one would need to check and explore to assess

```{R}
# traceplots
# checking model diagnostics

```

## Model Validation:

```{r}
# comparing estimates of diameter increment to observations
```

## convert tree diameters to AGB

```{R}
# code to estimate biomass
```

## Plot of AGB and AGBI with uncertainty

```{R}
# plot total and by taxa
```
