## Tree Ring Data

### Harvard Forest tree ring data

There are two foundational datasets used in the processing of these biomass estimates. The first is a tree ring dataset collected by the Harvard Forest Research Area in 2012. Three 20m plots were measured following a double-nested design. The following species were included in the final ring width dataset:

-   ACRU = red maple (Acer rubrum)
-   BEAL = yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis)
-   BELE = sweet birch (Betula lenta)
-   FAGR = American beech (Fagus grandifolia)
-   HAVI = Witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana)
-   PIST = Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus)
-   QURU = Northern red oak (Quercus rubra)
-   QUVE = Black oak (Quercus velutina)
-   TSCA = Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)

Harvard forest tree ring data samples were collected

## Harvard Forest Census Data

The second dataset for this site includes the census data measured for the Lyford Plots, which is available on the Harvard Forest data archive website. Censuses were conducted in 1962, 1969, 1975, 1987-1991, 2001, and 2011 and mapped all trees with DBH greater than 5 cm. in a mapped area covering 2.88 ha. The three ring-width plots include only a fraction of this area, and, therefore, we determined which census trees were located within the plot areas and considered only those trees for the model.
