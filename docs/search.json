The first is a tree ring dataset collected by the Harvard Forest Research Area in 2012. Three 20m plots were measured following a double-nested design. The following species were included in the final ring width dataset:\n\nACRU = red maple (Acer rubrum)\nBEAL = yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis)\nBELE = sweet birch (Betula lenta)\nFAGR = American beech (Fagus grandifolia)\nHAVI = Witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana)\nPIST = Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus)\nQURU = Northern red oak (Quercus rubra)\nQUVE = Black oak (Quercus velutina)\nTSCA = Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)\n\nHarvard forest tree ring data samples were collected\nCitation on tree ring dataset: Dye, A.
