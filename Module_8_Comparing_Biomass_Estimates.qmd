## Outline

-   Read in the outputs
-   Compare Total Aboveground Biomass over time for each method (data-only estimates, TR only model, TR + census model)
-   Compare Aboveground Biomass Increment over time for each method (data-only estimates, TR only model, TR + census model)
-   Relating AGBI estimates to climate drivers

### Read in all of the outputs of each model

```{R}

```

### Plot up total AGB and AGBI over time for each method

```{R}

```

### Plot up species-level AGB and AGBI over time for each method

```{R}

```

### Does variation in AGBI correspond to variation in climate?

```{R}

```
